            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LOng have tyrannicall in≈øolencie of the Rebels in Ireland exalted over the liberties, lives, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciences of the Prote≈øtants: and hath hitherto continued ≈øo cruell, bloudy, and inhumane, that it ≈øupifies almo≈øt amaze ment it ≈øelf: and withall, hath endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered the hazard of the Kingdome, But although they have triumphed thus in the continuation of their barbarous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity. Yet the All-≈øeeing eye of the Almighty, who≈øe impartiall Ju≈øtice will not permit nefarious deeds to ≈øleep in impunity, the omnipotency (I ≈øay) of the ≈øame eye hath frowned upon the Rebellious proceedings of tho≈øe ≈øavage
<pb facs="tcp:156466:3"/>mi≈øcreants, which cau≈øeth no onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity in the hearts of all, but al≈øo to heaven, for ≈øo ju≈øt an overthrow. Their repul≈øe was thus, as ≈øhall be ≈øub≈øequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared.</p>
            <p>The Citie of <hi>Dublin</hi> was ≈øuppo≈øed to have bin in great perill, being dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rou≈øly invironed, and begirt with the enemy both by Sea, and Land: Yea, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there were divers Letters ≈øent from We≈øtche≈øter, directed to the Hou≈øe of Commons, and read; who≈øe meaning did ≈øtrengthen the former ≈øu≈øpitiou: for they did intimate that Dublin was ≈øo circumvolved with the enemy, <hi>that it was almo≈øt thought to be de≈øtitute ef Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:</hi> Then it was forthwith Ordered by the Hou≈øe, that pre≈øent Aid ≈øhould be immediately rai≈øed, and ≈øent thither with great expedition, for fear if they ≈øhould procra≈øtinate the bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, any danger might en≈øue,</p>
            <p>Hereupon the Commi≈ø≈øion to pre≈ø≈øe (both for Land and Sea-men) did i≈ø≈øue
<pb facs="tcp:156466:3"/>forthwith to His Maje≈øties Officers. But in the mean time the Prote≈øtants ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered a head together, and unanimou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly con≈øulted to have a skirmi≈øh with the Rebels, and ≈øo to relieve the City of Dublin.</p>
            <p>The Earl of Ormond, Sir <hi>Charles Coot, and Sir Simon Harcourt</hi> mu≈øtred up their forces, and marched couragiou≈øly again≈øt them: whereupon at their fir≈øt fir≈øt On≈øet, there was a hot fray on both ≈øides, till at length Captain <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Stanvile</hi> came with three hundred men afre≈øh, and then they ≈ølew many of the Rebels, and made them recant, ≈øome fled, others hid them≈øelves: but ≈øtill they followed them, ≈ølaying a great number, rooting them from one Town to another: and ≈øo they rook <hi>Mac Brian</hi> Pri≈øoner, and driving them ≈øtill forward, they took <hi>Con Magenis at Care,</hi> and at the Town of Clogham they took <hi>Kory Magwire</hi> all Pri≈øoners, and committed them to the Ca≈øtle in Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</p>

            <p>We hope likewi≈øe, that by the auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary a≈ø≈øi≈øtance of Almighty God, that when our King and Parliament ≈øhall be graciou≈øly plea≈øed to ≈øend more aid thither, that we ≈øhall ≈øubdue the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rage of tho≈øe Rebels with facility.

God grant that all our battles may prove as fortunate, and ≈øucce≈ø≈øive as this hath, and then we doubt not but we ≈øhall become tr ly victorious: That the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øtant Religion do not thus initiate, and be fir≈øt a≈øcribed with the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of blood: That the pro≈øperous ≈øecuritie of the Briti≈øh Nation, be not overwhelmed with the turbulent bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bari≈øm of tho≈øe Wolvi≈øh Rebels.
